#Accept LinkedIn Invites
-----
Accepting LinkedIn Invitations is a painful process when there are more than 20 invitations. The process is error prone if you try to accept them in bulk and refresh the invite page too quickly. This script automates the process.

This project is based on NodeJs and Webdriver
